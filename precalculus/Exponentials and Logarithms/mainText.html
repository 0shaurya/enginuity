<h2>Exponentials and Logarithms</h2><br>
<p>
Let’s discuss another umbrella of functions, <b>exponential functions</b>. An exponential function is a function written in the form of

\[f(x)=ab^x\]

The important part here is how \(x\) is in the exponent - this key part is what makes it an exponential function. This is in contrast to polynomial functions, where \(x\) is in the base. Here is a graph of the function \(2^x\):

<br>
The first thing to notice is that \(2^x\) grows very fast. This is because the y-value doubles after each unit step in the x direction. This is because every time we add 1 to the x-value, the y value will be multiplied by 2 another time:

\[2^3 = 2\cdot2\cdot2 = 8\\2^4 = 2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2 = 16\\2^5 = 2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2 = 32\]:

Another thing to notice is what happens when \(x=0\). Any number raised to the 0th power is 1, meaning

\[f(0)=ab^0\]
\[f(0)=a\cdot1\]
\[f(0)=a\]

Thus, the y-intercept of an exponential function in the form \(f(x)=ab^x\) is always \(a\). We can verify this by graphing some more exponential functions:

Exponential equations come up a lot in the real world. For example, imagine 5 bacteria on a petri dish. Every hour, the number of bacteria doubles. This means that the number of bacteria follow the function \(B(t)=5\cdot2^t\), with \(t\) being the number of hours.
<br><br>
Now, let’s talk about solving equations with exponentials. Suppose we wanted to solve the equation \(3^x=10\), how would we go about doing it? \(3^2=9\) and \(3^3=27\), so we know the answer is very close to 2, but we do not have an exact form. Fortunately, we can use a <b>logarithm</b>.
<br><br>
A logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential, in the same way that multiplication is the inverse of division and subtraction is the inverse of addition.
<br><br>
A logarithm looks like:

\[g(x)=\log_b(x)\]

Here, \(b\) is the base of the logarithm. Logarithms are just a family of functions, and \(b\) is a parameter. We can relate exponential functions and logarithms by solving an equation:

\[3^x=10\]

Let’s apply a logarithm here. The base of the exponential is \(3\), so let’s apply a logarithm with base 3 to both sides.

\[\log_{3}{(3^x)}=\log_{3}{(10)}\]

Here is the key part of a logarithm - a logarithm of a base next to an exponential with the same base will cancel out, leaving only the power. In general:

\[\log_{b}{(b^a)} = \cancel{\log_{b}}(\cancel{b}^a) = a\]

This means that

\[\cancel{\log_{3}}(\cancel{3}^x)=\log_{3}{(10)}\]
\[x=\log_{3}{(10)}\]

Which, if you plug into a calculator, you will find is approximately \(2.096\). Here is a handy diagram that might help you relate exponentials and logarithms:

<br>
When we graph logarithms, we should remember that logarithms are just an inverse of exponentials. So, to graph a logarithmic function, we flip the corresponding exponential function over the line \(y=x\). Here is a graph of \(2^x\) and it's inverse, \(\log_2(x)\).
<br><br>

<br><br>
In general, the graph of a logarithm will look like a sideways exponential, with a vertical asymptote at \(x=0\), just like how the graph of an exponential has a horizontal asymptote at \(y=0\).
<br><br>
Now, let’s discuss some properties of logarithms. There are four main properties to know. Let’s start with the first one, the <b>product rule law</b>, which says

\[\log_{b}{(M\cdot N)}\ = \log_{b}{(M)}+\log_{b}{(N)}\]

For example, \(\log_{2}{(14)} = \log_{2}{(2\cdot6)} = \log_{2}{(2)}+\log_2(7) = 1+\log_2(7)\). This works because it is a parallel to the product rule for exponents law.
<br><br>
The second law is the <b>quotient rule law</b>. This says

\[\log_{b}{\biggl(\frac{M}{N}\biggl)} = \log_{b}{(M)} - \log_{b}{(N)}\]

For example, \(\log_{5}{\Bigl(\frac{2}{5}\Bigl)}=\log_{5}{(2)}-\log_5(5)=\log_5(2)-1\). This law works because it is parallel to the quotient rule for exponents law.
<br><br>
The third law is the <b>power rule law</b>. This says

\[\log_{b}{(a^c)}=c\cdot\log_{b}{(a)}\]

For example, \(\log_{3}{(32)} = \log_{3}{(2^5)} = 5\log_{3}{(2)}\). This law works because it is just the product rule repeated \(c\) times.
<br><br>
The fourth law is the <b>change of base law</b>. This law says that

\[\log_{b}{(a)} =\frac{\log_d(a)}{\log_d(b)}\]

where \(d\) can be any number. For example, \(\log_{2}{(7)} = \frac{\log_3(7)}{\log_3(2)} = \frac{\log_4(7)}{\log_4(2)} = \frac{\log_5(7)}{\log_5(2)}\)
