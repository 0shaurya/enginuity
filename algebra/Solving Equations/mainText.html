<h2>Solving Equations</h2><br>
<p>
In the last topic, we covered the basics of linear equations. Now, letâ€™s talk about how to solve equations with more than one variable.
	Here's the process that we'll be using to solve these types of equations:<br>
1. Simplify both sides of the equation (fractions, paranthesis, and like terms) <br>
2. Shift all terms containing variables to one side, and the terms without variables to the other side <br>
3. Combine the like terms to get one instance of the variables and of the non-variable terms <br>
4. Finally, divide by the coeffecient of the variable <br>
	<br>
	
	<b>**</b>These steps will be used in almost each equation, but there are always exceptions.<b>**</b> <br>
</p>

<p>
	Let's look at all these steps of the process in this example:
	<b>Solve \(A\) = \(P(1+xy\)) <b>for</b> \(x\)</b> <br>

	<br>We're looking for an expression in the form:<u>
	 <b>\(x\) = Equation involving numbers, \( A, P,\) and \(y\)</b></u> <br>
	
	As you can see, we've isolated the \(x\) on the left side of the equation; it's not visible anywhere else. <br>
	<br>
	<b>1.</b> Let's multiply the \(P\) through the paranthesis: \(A\) = \(P + Pxy\) <br>
	
	<br><b>2 / 3.</b> Shift all the terms with an \(x\) on one (left) side. In this equation, that is already done for us. But, we still have to shift the terms without an \(x\) on one side:  \(A -P\) = \(Pxy\) <br>
	
	<br><b>4.</b> Lastly, we divide both sides by the coeffecient of \(x\), which is just \(Py\). <br> \(\frac{A - P}{Py} = r\) &#x27F6; \(r = \frac{A - P}{Py}\)
