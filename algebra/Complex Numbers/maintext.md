<h2>Complex Numbers</h2><br>

<p>

Now that we’ve covered how to solve equations, let’s see how to solve the following equation for \(x\):

  
$$
x^2=-1
$$
  

To get x alone, we take the square root of both sides:

  
$$
x=\sqrt{-1}
$$
  

So, $x$ is equal to the square root of negative one. But, what does that actually mean? Well, let’s remember that the square root of something is the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals that something. For example, the square root of $25$ is $5$ because $5\cdot5=25$. So, what number times itself equals $-1$?

  

When we multiply a positive number by itself, the answer is positive. When we multiply a negative number by itself, the answer is positive as well, because a negative times a negative equals a positive. For example:

  

$$-5\cdot-5=25$$

$$-6\cdot-6=36$$

  

This means that no matter what number we multiply by itself, we will never get a negative answer. Because of this, there is no number that we can square to get $-1$, so $\sqrt{-1}$ does not have an answer.

<br><br>

To solve this problem, mathematicians introduced a new number to solve this problem: <b>$i$</b>. We defined $i$ squared to be negative $1$:

  

$i^2=-1$

$i = \sqrt{-1}$

  

$i$ is not a variable. It is a number, in the same way that $1, 2, 3, 4…$ are all numbers. However, it is a different type of number, an <b>imaginary number</b>. Let's first establish what a <b>real number</b> is. A real number a number that exists on the number line: $5$, $-3$, $\frac{2}{5}$, $\pi$ are all examples of real numbers. An imaginary number is a real number multiple by $i$. For example, $5i$ is an imaginary number because it is $5\cdot i$, or $5\cdot\sqrt{-1}$. All imaginary numbers are still numbers - we can add, subtract, and do all sorts of stuff with them, just like with real numbers. However, imaginary numbers are solutions to equations that contain the square root of a negative number. For example, look at:

  

$x=\sqrt{-49}$

  

To see what $x$ is, let's run through these steps:

  

$x= \sqrt{49 \cdot -1}$

  

We use properties of roots:

  

$x=\sqrt{49}\cdot\sqrt{-1}$

  

And recall our definition of $i$:

  

$x=7i$

  

Thus, the square root of negative $49$ is $7i$.

<br><br>

Now that we have the basis of imaginary numbers, down let's look at <b>complex numbers</b>. Complex numbers are just a real number added to an imaginary number. In general, a complex number can be written as:

  

$a+bi$

  

where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. A complex number has a real part $a$ and an imaginary part $bi$ . Some examples of complex numbers are $3+i$, $1-5i$, $2-i$, and $\frac{3}{5}+\frac{6}{11}i$.

<br><br>

With just the real numbers, you only need the number line to list all of them out. Now that we have another type of number, we need a second line to graph them out. This brings us to the <b>complex plane</b>. The complex plane is the number line, but in two dimensions instead of one. It contains every real number, imaginary number, and complex number. Let's look at the complex plane:

In the graphs that we looked at earlier, we graphed functions. In the complex plane, we graph numbers as points. In the graph above, we are plotting the real number $-3$, the imaginary number $2i$, and the complex number $3+4i$. Notice how the complex number $3+4i$ is plotted $- 3$ units right, $4$ units up. Each unit right corresponds to the real part of the complex number, and each unit up corresponds to the imaginary part of the complex number.
