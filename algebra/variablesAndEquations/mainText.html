<h1>Algebra</h1><h2>Variables and Equations</h2><br>
<p>

Often in math, we have to deal with problems that force us to find what number something is. For example, say Alice and Bob have a combined total of 10 apples. We know Alice has 6 apples, and our goal is to find the number of apples Bob has. Let’s talk about this scenario in a math way:
<br><br>
\[\text{Number of apples Alice has}\; +\; \text{Number of apples Bob has} \;= \;10\]
<br>
Because Alice has 6 apples, Bob must have 4 to make this equation work:
<br><br>
\[6 + \text{Number of apples Bob has} = 10\]
<br>
It’s important to notice that the Number of apples Bob has is an unknown, because the question does not give the straight number -  we have to solve the problem to figure that out. We call these unknowns <b>variables</b>. Variables just represent an unknown number.
<br><br>
Because writing out “Number of apples Bob has” can get tedious, let’s just shorten that to “\(b\)”, for Bob. \(b\) is a variable. So, we can model the question in the following way:
<br><br>
\[6 + b = 10\]
\[\text{Solve for }b\]
<br>
  Here, \(6 + b = 10\) is an <b>equation</b>. An equation is simply two expressions with an equal sign in between. Here, our expressions are \(6 + b\) and \(10\). <b>Expressions</b> are simply a set of numbers or variables that interact with each other using <b>operations</b>. Operations are things like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
<br><br>
  Another important thing to know is what a <b>constant</b> is. A constant is simply a number. In our equation, \(6\) and \(10\) are constants.
  <br><br>
  Most of the time, you will see variables as \(x\). But, remember that variables can be any symbol (in fact, they don't even have to be a letter!).
