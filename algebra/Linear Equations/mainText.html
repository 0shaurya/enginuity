<h2>Linear Equations</h2><br>
<p>
In the last topic, we covered the parts of an equation. Now, letâ€™s talk about a certain type of an equation: the Linear Equation. A linear equation is an equation that consists of a variable multiplied by a number, added to a constant. For example, \(12x-5=0\) is a linear equation. So is \(58x+119=0\). In general, a linear equation can be written as:

\[ax+b = 0\]

Where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants and and \(x\) is a variable. Note that you will often see \(x\) as a variable. 
<br><br>
In a linear equation, \(a\) is a <b>coefficient</b>. A coefficient is the number next to a variable - the coefficient is always multiplied by the variable. The coefficient is negative if the term is being subtracted.
<br><br>
For example, in the expression \(38x^2\), the coefficient is \(38\).
<br>In the expression \(-45z\), the coefficient is \(-45\).
<br>In the expression \(3x^5z\), the coefficient is \(3\).
<br>In the expression \(-12y^2p^5\), the coefficient is \(-12\).
