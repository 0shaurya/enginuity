<h2>Functions and Graphing</h2><br>
<p>
Let’s begin by going over what a function is. At its simplest level, a function will take in a number, apply some operation to it, and output another number. Let’s go over notation first.

Functions are denoted by \(f(x) = \text{Some function}\). (Note that it doesn’t have to be \(f(x)\), it could be \(g(x)\), \(h(x)\), or any other letter. However, it’s usually \(f\)). Some example of functions are:

\[f(x) =  x^3+2\]
\[g(x) = \frac{2}{x}-3\]
\[h(x) = \sqrt{x}\]

The input here is the \(x\) in parentheses after the \(f\), \(g\), and \(h\). When inputting a number into the x value, we substitute every x inside the function for that number. For example:

\[f(x) =  x^3+2\]
\[f(5) = 5^3+2\]
\[f(5) = 127\]
<br>
\[g(x) = \frac{2}{x}-3\]
\[g(0.5) = \frac{2}{0.5}-3 = 1\]

That’s how we write functions algebraically. We can also visualize them using tables. Consider the following table for the function \(f(x) = 3x+1\):
<br><br>
<table>
	<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>\(x\)</th>
		<th>\(f(x)\)<br></th>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>-2</td>
		<td>-5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>-1</td>
		<td>-2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>7</td>
	</tr>
	<tbody>
</table>
<br>
Or, we can use graphs. Functions on graphs are very useful and common. This is the graph for the same function \(f(x) = 3x+1\):
<br>
<img src="../../visuals/3x+1.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto;">
<br>
On the x-axis (big horizontal line), lies the value of an x value (an input to the function). On the y-axis (big vertical line), lies the corresponding f(x) value. For example, 3 units to the right of the origin (the origin is where the two axes cross), the y value is 10, because \(f(3) = 10\).
<br><br>
An important note about functions: when inputting a number into a function, the function should always return either 1 or 0 numbers. In other words, inputting a number into a function can never give 2 (or more) results. For example, the following graph is not a function:
<br>
<img src="../../visuals/implicitfunction.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto;">
<br>
because at \(x=1\), there are two y values. You can use something called the <b>vertical line test</b> to test if an equation on a graph is actually a function. If you can make at least 1 vertical line on the graph that crosses the equation at least twice, then the equation automatically not a function.
