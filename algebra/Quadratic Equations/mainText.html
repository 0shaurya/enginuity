<h1>Algebra</h1><h2>Quadratic Equations</h2><br>
<p>

Let’s go over one type of polynomial, quadratic equations. Quadratic equations are functions that can be written in the following form:

\[f(x)=ax^2+bx+c\]

where a, b, and c are real numbers. A quadratic equation is called a parabola, and has a U shape on a graph. All of these are examples of quadratic equations, or parabolas:

As you can see, parabolas can either open down or open up. The orange and blue parabolas open up, and the green and red parabolas open down. A parabola opens up when \(a\) is positive, and open downs when \(a\) is negative. When \(a\) is \(0\), the entire first term is canceled out and it becomes a linear function.
<br><br>
Another thing to notice is the root(s) of an equation. The root of a quadratic equation \(f(x)\) is when it hits the x-axis, or when \(f(x)=0\). A quadratic equation can have 0, 1, or 2 real roots (a root can also be called a solution). If an equation has 1 real root, it is known as a <b>double root</b>. In the earlier image, the red and orange parabolas have 2 roots, because they cross the x-axis twice, the blue parabola has 0 roots, because it never crosses the x-axis, and the green parabola has 1 root (a double root), because it crosses the x-axis only once.
<br><br>
Sometimes, it’s important to find the x-values of the roots of an equation. The roots of an equation are the answers to the following formula, known as the <b>Quadratic Formula</b>:
<br><br>
\[x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\]
\[\text{The Quadratic Formula}\]
<br>
The important thing to notice is the \(b^2-4ac\) part. This is known as the <b>discriminant</b> of the quadratic equation. If the discriminant is negative, it has 0 real solutions, if the discriminant is 0, it has 1 real solution (a double root), and if the discriminant is positive, it has 2 real solutions.
<br><br>
If a quadratic equation has 0 real solutions, then that means that it has 2 complex solutions. For example, take the function \(g(x)=x^2+1\). On a graph, this parabola looks like:

<img src="../../../visuals/x^2+1.png" style="display:block;margin:auto auto;">

Because this parabola never crosses the x-axis, it has 0 real roots. However, plugging the following into the Quadratic Equation gives us:

\[x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\]
\[x = \frac{-0\pm\sqrt{0^2-4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}\]
\[x = \frac{\pm\sqrt{-4}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{\pm2i}{2}\]
\[x = \pm{i}\]
\[x = i, -i\]

We can see that there actually are roots to this equation - the roots are positive \(i\) and negative \(i\). Thus, this equation has 2 imaginary roots and 0 real roots. In fact, all quadratic equations have either 2 real roots, 1 double-root, or 2 complex roots.
