<h1>Algebra</h1><h2>Systems of Equations</h2><br>
<p>

A <b>system of equations</b> is a group of multiple equations with multiple variables. Usually, it is mostly impossible to solve for an equation if you are only given one equation - however, with multiple equations, we can solve for multiple variables.

Take a look at the following system of equations:

\[\text{This is a system of equations:} \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
2b=3a \\
b-7=-2a
\end{array} \right.\]

Here, \(a\) and \(b\) are variables. We are trying to solve for the combination of \(a\) and \(b\) that make both equations true. To understand it better, let’s look at a graph:
<img src="../../visuals/systemofequations.png", style="display:block; margin:auto auto;">
We can clearly see that both equations intersect at \(a=2\) and \(b=3\). This is our solution, because both the equations intersect at this point. We have just graphically solved the system of equations. Let’s try to solve it algebraically now.
<br><br>
To solve it algebraically, we will employ a technique known as <b>substitution</b>. Substitution is a method of solving one variable in terms of the other variable, and then substituting that into the other equation. Let’s solve for \(b\) in terms of \(a\):

\[b-7=-2a\]
\[b=-2a+7\]

Now that we have \(b\) in terms of \(a\), we can substitute that back into the first equation.

\[2b=3a\]
\[2b=3a\]
\[2(-2a+7)=3a\]
\[-4a+14=3a\]
\[-7a+14=0\]
\[-7a=-14\]
\[a=2\]

We have solved for \(a\) now. To find \(b\), we need to plug the value of \(a\) back into an equation (it doesn’t matter which one). Let’s use the first equation.

\[2b=3a\]
\[2b=3(2)\]
\[2b=6\]
\[b=3\]

We now have our answers: \(a=2, b=3\). These match up with the intersection on the graph.

Recap:<br>
The steps for solving a system of equations are:<br>
1. Solve the first variable in terms of the second using an equation.<br>
2. Substitute the first variable for the other equation to solve for the second variable.<br>
3. Solve for the first variable by plugging the second variable into any equation.<br>
